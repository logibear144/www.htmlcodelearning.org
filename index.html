    <h1>Hi am going to write a small article on how to code in HTML.</h1><h2>By Logan Lecas</h2><p>Hi ready to learn? Well start with the sample codes here try them out later. Use the code &ltp>Text Here&lt/p><br> use &lth1>Title Text&lt/h1> to insert a title and use &lth2>Subheader <br>Text Here&lt/h2> to insert a subheader. Simple, try it on the website about:blank and use keyboard shortcut ctrl+shift+i and go under &ltbody>&lt/body> and try it! (This article was made by <br>Html using these codes.)</p>
